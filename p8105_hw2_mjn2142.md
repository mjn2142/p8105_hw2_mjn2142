### Problem 1

``` r
trash_wheel_data = readxl::read_excel("./new_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N535") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)
  )

median_data = filter(trash_wheel_data, year == "2019")

median(median_data$sports_balls)
```

    ## [1] 9

Read in Precipitation Data

``` r
twenty_eighteen_precipitation = readxl::read_excel("./new_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  add_column(
    year = "2018"
  )
  

twenty_nineteen_precipitation = readxl::read_excel("./new_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  add_column(
    year = "2019"
  )

precipitation_df =
  full_join(twenty_eighteen_precipitation, twenty_nineteen_precipitation, by = c("month" = "month", "year" = "year", "total" = "total")) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])

sum(twenty_eighteen_precipitation$total)
```

    ## [1] 70.33

Dataset Discussion: The Mr. Traswheel dataset has 453 rows and 14
columns. The median number of sports balls in 2019 is 9. Important
columns of data include “weight\_tons”, “plastic\_bottles”, and
“homes\_powered.” This data gives a powerful look into the contents of
dumpsters. The combined precipation dataset has 24 rows and 3 columns.
The sum of totals in 2018 is 70.33. The three columns are month, total,
and year. Combining the datasets allows for trends in precipitation to
be seen across both months and years.

### Problem 2

Cleaning pols-month data

``` r
pols_month_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(
    col = mon,
    into = c('year', 'month', 'day'),
    sep = '-',
    remove = TRUE,
    convert = TRUE,
    extra = 'warn',
    fill = 'warn'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month],
    president = recode(prez_gop, '1' = "gop", '0' = "dem")
    ) %>% 
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem)
```

Clean snp data

``` r
snp_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    lubridate::mdy(date)
  ) %>% 
  separate(
    col = 'lubridate::mdy(date)',
    into = c('year', 'month', 'day'),
    sep = '-',
    remove = TRUE,
    convert = TRUE,
    extra = 'warn',
    fill = 'warn'
  ) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, day) %>% 
    mutate(
      month = month.abb[month],
      year = if_else(year > 2021, year - 100, as.numeric(year))
    ) %>% 
  select(-date)
```

Clean unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_level"
  ) %>% 
  rename(year = Year)
```

Join datasets

``` r
pols_snp_joined = 
  inner_join(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month"))

join_final =
  inner_join(pols_snp_joined, unemployment_data, by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month"))
```

Dataset Discussion: The three datasets were merged by year and month in
an inner join so only rows where all three datasets had information for
shared years and month are shown. There are 786 rows and 12 columns. The
first dataset contains information on political makeups of the US
government during various periods of time. The second shows stock value
for Standard and Poor. The third dataset contains unemployment levels
across time. These datasets can be merged because they share temporal
values, and together they can elucidate a clearer political-economic
understanding of a specific month and year in history. The years range
from 1947 to 2015. Important variables include GOP representatives and
Democratic representatives, closing, and unemployment.These show how
political power, stock prices, and unemployment are connected.

### Problem 3

Read in and tidy baby names data

``` r
baby_names = read_csv("./Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACI", "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISP", "BLACK NON HISPANIC"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP", "WHITE NON HISPANIC")
  ) %>% 
  distinct(year_of_birth, ethnicity, childs_first_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

Table of “Olivia” Popularity over Time

``` r
olivia_df = pivot_wider(
  baby_names,
  names_from = year_of_birth,
  values_from = rank
) %>% 
  filter(childs_first_name == "Olivia")
```

Popularity of Male Names over Time

``` r
male_df = filter(
  baby_names,
  rank == "1",
  gender == "MALE"
) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
  names_from = year_of_birth,
  values_from = rank
) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Scatter Plot for Male White Non-Hispanic in 2016

``` r
scatterplot_df = filter(
  baby_names,
  gender == "MALE",
  ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC",
  year_of_birth == "2016"
)

plot_male = ggplot(scatterplot_df, aes(rank, count)) + geom_point()

plot_male + ggtitle(c("Popularity of Male Names in 2016")) + xlab("Rank in Popularity of Name") + ylab("Number of Children with Name")
```
